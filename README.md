# Abstract

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the regular functioning of a network, service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks pose a substantial threat to network security. Detecting these attacks in real time is a critical challenge. Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks has several significant benefits for organizations and network security. The major goal of this research paper is to use machine-learning algorithms to detect DDoS attacks, and to determine which algorithms are the most effective in terms of confusion matrix, accuracy, and cross-validation score. For the categorization of benign and malicious attacks, many Machine Learning algorithms have been applied. The dataset sdn Dataset, which includes 1,04,345 samples and 23 characteristics, was used. On the dataset collected from the Kaggle repository, the study focuses on several models that are implemented, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN). Each of these algorithms has been tested and compared in terms of accuracy and cross-validation score. All of the methods are implemented in Python and run in Google Colab, a Scientific Python Development Environment. Random Forest classifier is shown to be the most accurate for predictive analysis.
Two types of requests can be found here. Two types of requests: benign and malicious.
