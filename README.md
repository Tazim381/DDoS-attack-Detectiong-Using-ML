A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the
regular functioning of a network, service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood
of internet traffic. DDoS attacks pose a substantial threat to network security. Detect-
ing these attacks in real time is a critical challenge. Detecting Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks has several significant benefits for organizations and network
security. The major goal of this research paper is to use machine-learning algorithms
to detect DDoS attacks, and to determine which algorithms are the most effective in
terms of confusion matrix, accuracy and cross-validation score. For the categoriza-
tion of benign and malicious attacks, many Machine Learning algorithms have been
applied. The dataset sdn Dataset, which includes 1,04,345 samples and 23 character-
istics, was used. On the dataset collected from Kaggle repository, the study focuses
on several models that are implemented, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbour
(KNN) etc. Each of these algorithms has been tested and compared in terms of ac-
curacy and cross-validation score. All of the methods are implemented in Python and
run in Google Colab, a Scientific Python Development Environment. Random Forest
Classifier is shown to be the most accurate for predictive analysis, with 100% accuracy.

Benign requests are non-attacks, whereas malicious re
